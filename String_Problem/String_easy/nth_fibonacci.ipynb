    "1.` Memoization Cache (Dictionary):`  when we are creating dictionary `memo={}` inside the function, we are creating the dictionary every time the function is called for first    time. This dictionary will store all the fibonacci results for that particular function call, but its shared across all recursive calls. This allows the function to store the  previous calculations and reuse them - thats the power of Memoization.  The keys are fibonacci numbers `(n)` and the values are corresponding results. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Time complexity:` with memoization, each fibonaaci numbers is calculated only once, so the time complexity drops from O(2^n) to O(n) because we compute each value only once and looks up for previous results in constant time `O(1)`.\n",
